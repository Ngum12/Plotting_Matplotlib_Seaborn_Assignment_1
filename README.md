My Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vehicle fuel efficiency using a comprehensive dataset that includes various attributes related to vehicles, such as make, model, year, fuel type, and emissions. The analysis aims to provide insights into fuel efficiency trends, carbon dioxide emissions, and other related statistics, which can inform decisions in the transportation sector.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `fuel_econ.csv` and contains the following columns:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each vehicle entry.
- **make**: Manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Nissan, Volkswagen).
- **model**: Model name of the vehicle (e.g., GT-R, CC).
- **year**: The year the vehicle was manufactured.
- **VClass**: Vehicle classification (e.g., Compact Cars, Midsize Cars).
- **drive**: Type of drive (e.g., Front-Wheel Drive, All-Wheel Drive).
- **trans**: Transmission type (e.g., Automatic, Manual).
- **fuelType**: Type of fuel used (e.g., Premium Gasoline, Regular Gasoline).
- **cylinders**: Number of cylinders in the engine.
- **displ**: Engine displacement (in liters).
- **city**: City fuel economy (miles per gallon or equivalent).
- **highway**: Highway fuel economy (miles per gallon or equivalent).
- **comb**: Combined fuel economy (miles per gallon or equivalent).
- **co2**: CO2 emissions (grams per mile).
- **feScore**: Fuel economy score.
- **ghgScore**: Greenhouse gas score.

## Purpose

The analysis conducted in this project aims to:

- Visualize the distribution of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel efficiency.
- Identify trends and correlations between vehicle characteristics and fuel efficiency.
- Provide insights that can be used for AI applications in transportation and environmental impact assessments.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborni

Load the dataset:
Make sure to upload the dataset fuel_econ.csv to your Google Drive or local directory.
Run the analysis:
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script and execute the code cells to perform the analysis.
Analysis Steps
Data Loading: Load the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
Histograms: Create histograms to visualize the distribution of CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency metrics.
Boxplots: Generate boxplots to identify outliers and understand the spread of emissions and efficiency data.
Heatmap: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between various vehicle attributes.
Interpretation: Analyze the visualizations to derive insights about vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency.
Results
The histograms reveal the distribution patterns of CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency, indicating common ranges and potential areas for improvement.
Boxplots highlight the presence of outliers and the overall spread of the data.
The heatmap provides insights into relationships between different vehicle attributes, which can inform future analyses and decisions.
Future Work
Explore further correlations and trends in the data.
Investigate additional datasets to enhance the analysis.
Apply machine learning techniques to predict GHG scores based on vehicle attributes.
